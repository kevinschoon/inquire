Inquire is a lightweight web crawler and http discovery tool.
I am often asked "what is this website running on?" or "who is hosting that?".
To answer such a question I need to employ multiple commandline tools
to inspect host headers, perform DNS lookup, inspect source code,
etc. Inquire attempts to implement general purpose functionality for
answering these questions.
